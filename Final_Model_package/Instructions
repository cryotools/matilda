The Final Model is available as a python package in your local environment. To install, navigate the terminal in the downloaded finalmodel folder and use pip (or pip3) with the following command:
pip3 install .
This installs the package on your computer and should be accessible from all other files.

The package requires the following python packages 'pandas' , 'xarray', 'matplotlib', 'numpy', 'scipy' which should be automatically installed with installing the finalmodel as described. 

The finalmodel contains the following parts: degree day model (DDM), HBV model (HBV), simple statistical description (stats) and plots for the runoff, meteorological parameters and HBV output (plots). 

As input, dataframes with temperature (in Celsius, T2), precipitation (in mm, RRR) and if possible potential evapotranspiration (in mm, PE) daily observations are required as well as runoff observations (inmm, Qobs) to evaluate the output.

An example run of the model can be found at runmodel.py and the following workflow is recommened:
- read in the data and adjust the variable names, units and timesteps
- specify the calibration period (one year is recommended)
- the calculate_pdd function calculates the positive degree days and the calculate_melt function uses this output to apply the degree day model
- the HBV_simulation runs the HBV model and calculates PE if neccessary
- combine the two outputs (calculate_melt + hbv_simulation)
- adjust the time to daily, monthly or yearly steps, depending on your desired output
- use the create_statistics function to get a simple dataframe with statistical measures
- use the different plot function to plot runoff, parameters and HBV output
