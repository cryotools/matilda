lr_temp    - Lapse rate of air temperature (ascending) (K/m)
           [-0.01, -0.003] (usually -0.006)
lr_prec    - Lapse rate of precipitation (ascending) (mm/m)
           [0, 0.002]
BETA       - Parameter that determines the relative contribution to runoff from rain or snowmelt
           [1, 6]
CET        - Evaporation correction factor (should be 0 if you don't want to change Oudin formula values)
           [0, 0.3]
FC         - Maximum soil moisture storage
           [50, 500]
K0         - Recession coefficient for surface soil box (upper part of SUZ)
           [0.01, 0.4]
K1         - Recession coefficient for upper groundwater box (main part of SUZ)
           [0.01, 0.4]
K2         - Recession coefficient for lower groundwater box (whole SLZ)
           [0.001, 0.15]
LP         - Threshold for reduction of evaporation (SM/FC)
           [0.3, 1]
MAXBAS     - Routing parameter, order of Butterworth filter
           [2, 7]
PERC       - Percolation from soil to upper groundwater box
           [0, 3]
UZL        - Threshold parameter for groundwater boxes runoff (mm)
           [0, 500]
PCORR      - Precipitation (input sum) correction factor
           [0.5, 2]
TT_snow    - Temperature below which all precipitation is solid. Between TT_snow and TT_rain fractions of liquid and solid precipitation change linearly (°C).
           [-1.5, 1.5]
TT_diff    - Difference of TT_snow and temperature above which all precipitation is liquid (TT_rain). (°K)
           [0.5, 2.5]
CFMAX_ice - Ice melt rate (mm/day per K above freezing point).
           [1.2, 12]
CFMAX_rel  - Factor to calculate snow melt rate from CFMAX_ice. CFMAX_snow =  CFMAX_ice / CFMAX_rel
           [1.2, 2.5]
SFCF       - Snowfall correction Factor
           [0.4, 1]
CWH        - Fraction (portion) of meltwater and rainfall which retains in snowpack (water holding capacity).
           [0, 0.2] (usually 0.1)
AG	   - Calibration parameter for glacier storage-release scheme. High values result in a small reservoir and instant release. Low values extend storage and delay release.
	   [0, 1]
RFS  	   - Fraction of melt water that refreezes in snowpack.
           [0.05, 0.25]
           
pfilter    - Threshold above which precipitation values are elevation scaled using lr_prec. This addresses the common issue of reanalysis data to overestimate the frequency of
	     low precipitation events. Handle with care! Should be fixed depending on the input data before parameter optimization.
	   [0, 0.5]
